# Experimental Beta Changes
As most of you have noticed, we recently rolled out a set of experimental changes to
our live server. This was with the purpose of not only simplifying the experience of
the average player but also toning down the general gameplay speed that many players
struggle width. Mainly, Assassin is too fast to fight with combinations like Evade and
Flash or a standalone Leap build. 

This first developer blog aims to help everybody understand *why* we made these changes,
and if they will stay at all. Here we go.

## Why?
To sum it up: the game is too fast, in an unorthodox way. Assassin has all the main
components that make other kits good, all combined into one. The other kits feel slow, so
Assassin's mobility effectiveness is exacerbated by how slow everything else is. Lastly,
damage output is astronomical, especially Assassin and Mage. In combination, the fast
movement some skills offer and high damage output directly decrease the time to to get a
kill (refered to as *TTK* in the rest of this blog), making fights shorter and the need
for really quick reaction time higher.

### Assassin's Mobility
As was mentioned before, Assassin has really high mobility. It is the most mobile kit in
the game, even despite the experimental changes made to Ranger. To establish a
comparison, Ranger has very mobile options in its kit such as Wolfs Pounce, Wind Burst,
Roped Arrow, and Kinetics. However, Assassin still outshines it because its skill are
much more **versatile**. Because Flash's teleport distance is so short and its downtime
is essentially nil, it provides an easy way to engage, navigate, and escape a fight.
Leap, on the other hand, is a little less versatile but it is much more consistent,
meaning it's easier to stay out once you've already gotten out.

Some kits being this fast while others having little to no movement opportunities at all,
directly hinders the experience of players using the latter. We saw an influx of
complaints made by tank players who were very frustrated that Assassin was seemingly
impossible to catch, forcing them to take the mirror matchup to stand a chance. On the
flip side, it also felt impossible to escape a fight, so there was really no benefit to
playing tank in a movement-rich meta. 

### High Damage Output
The TTK in our iteration of the game used to be really high on launch. In updates 
following our release, we made some changes to mitigate that. Unfortunately, we seemed
to have overshot some values, causing TTK to go from *ill-kill-you-in-three-business-day* 
to *i-closed-my-eyes-for-a-second-and-i-died*. This was made very notorious in the Blink-Sever and the Rupture-Pestilence metas. 

### Skill ceilings and skill floors
Skill ceilings and skill floors are a way for us to control what can and can't be done
with a kit, both at best and worst levels of gameplay. If we increase a kit's skill
celing, then the skill expression of that kit is more noticeable and one can feel it to be
more rewarding. If we decrease a kit's skill floor, then the power of that kit at its base will be better and using it will becoming more rewarding without requiring much effort. 

Most kits have controlled skill ceilings by restricting certain behaviors or 
breakpoints on skill. An example of this is Inferno with a simple hold-and-shoot 
mechanic, and Seismic Slam with a classic point-and-click one. These skills feel easy to
use because their skill floor is very low, but their equally low skill ceiling also make 
it feel like you can't get much more out of the skill.

There has to be a balance between a skill floor and a skill ceiling, because it could
open the door for what we call *noob skills* or for a single skill to dominate the entire
lobby. People tend to not care when somebody gets stomped on by someone who is using 
Flash very effectively because it is perceived as skillfull, whereas they are disgusted 
by the sight of somebody using Sever and Viper Strikes to almost one-tap them.

This brings me to my point: Assassin's skill ceiling and skill floor are both too high. 
The kit is hard to use at base, and its skill ceiling being infinitely-high make so hard 
to master. We are still seeing new techniques be discovered to this very date. However,
this has come at the cost of other kits suffering from this grand mastery of Assassin, 
because players can only be as good as their kit allows them to be.

### The big three
Finally, let's go back to the components we mentioned Assassin steals from other kits and
condenses all into its kit. In our vision, the three necessary components for a kit to
be viable in this game are the following:

- Engage
- Sustain
- Escape

While most kits have two, at most, Assassin possesses all three. Brute has all the engage
and sustain in the world, but it lacks escape after comitting everything to engage in a
fight. Warlock has engage with Grasp and its speed skills, sustain with its healing and
damage reduction skills, although it lacks escape. The other three kits only possess a
single one of them, which is why they are perceived as the worst of the 6 kits: Mage with
only engage, Knight with only sustain, and Ranger with only escape.

Enter Assassin. It has it all. It has engage with all three of the movement skills. It
can extend a fight with either Evade, Smoke Bomb or Recall, therefore increasing its
sustain. And it also has escape with any axe or drop passive that they haven't already
used. This, combined with the exponentially high skill ceiling of the kit, pair to make a
deadly combination of damage and mobility that make the kit so fun, but so obnoxious to
fight. 

The reality is that, if you aren't already accustomed to moving your mouse at hyperspeed
to fight an Assassin flashing around you, you're likely to be intimidated by this
gameplay. This is why we feel something has to change, despite what many will think or
say.

## Our Plan
While everybody would love to nerf Assassin to the ground, it's simply not the fix. It is 
the most beloved kit of the roster, and we think the solution is not to reduce mobility, 
but rather increase it across the board. It may seem counterintuitive, but high movement 
feels fun and being slow does not. Our solution is to level the playing field and provide 
everybody a way to catch up to targets who run away, and another to escape fights when 
needed.

Of course, this all comes with reducing damage values on most skills and tinkering with 
health statistics on kits, but the general idea is already in play. In turn, we should 
except a much more dynamic game, with faster gameplay on kits that were slow. On the 
contrary, we must also reduce movement for kits that feel too fast, just so we can give a 
little bit of breathing room to those who are not. This allows us to nerf Assassin's 
movement a bit and buff it for other kits, so the entire gameplay loop feels much more fair, without removing the fun of mobility.

### Removing Skill Levels
The most controversial change, as we expected, was the removal of skill levels. This 
change does not come out of out the blue, and was really thought through before being 
applied. We have explored many other balancing options to make skills pair well with each 
other and have fair matchups for every kit. However, this was to no avail, as some skills 
just simply could not be used without investing a big percentage of your skill tokens 
(41%!), while others didn't make sense to invest into.

Our previous balancing philosophy with skill levels posed two problems:
- Most skills required too many levels to be viable.
- The remaining skills made very little sense to invest skill tokens into.

Some examples of this are:
- Flash 5 is usable while Flash 1 is not.
- Pestilence 5 is usable while Pestilence 1 is not.
- Leap 1 is usable while Leap 5 is not necessary in the current meta.
