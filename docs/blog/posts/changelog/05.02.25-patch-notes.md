# Content Update 5/2/2025
## Combat

### Knight
!!! note "Developer's Note"
    Knight has historically been underpowered in comparison to Brute in our iteration of the game. 
    Adding some mobility with Shield Smash kickback will give it a bit more survivability. Battlebind 
    will also encourage players to make combos with Magnetic Axe and Shield Smash to see more variety.
- Shield Smash hitbox increased
- Shield Smash now knocks back the caster when colliding with a solid block.
- Shield Smash now has a small kickback when colliding with a player.
- Add Battlebind sword skill
- Shoot your sword forward and deal small damage to the player it hits. The enemy hit will be pulled towards you.
- Hold Position  cooldown 25 -> 20 seconds
- Hold Position duration 4 -> 6 seconds
 
### Brute
!!! note "Developer's Note"
    Takedown is a little underwhelming in the face of Seismic Slam. It's already too mobile, so 
    hopefully a damge buff will see an increase in usage.
- Takedown damage 5.0 -> 7.0
 
### Ranger
- Add Wind Dagger sword skill
- Shoot your sword forward and damage the first enemy it hits.
