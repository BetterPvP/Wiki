# Content Update 7/2/2025
## Combat

### Assassin
!!! note "Developer's Note"
    While we do not want to increase Assassin's uptime in a fight to avoid it being obnoxious to
    fight against, we do recognize it is a little underpowered in comparison to the other kits. 
    Hopefully, increase its damage over time will change it to be a more rewarding kit.

- Combo Attack
    * Damage increment per hit increased 0.5 → 0.8 HP
    * Max bonus damage increased 2.0 → 2.4 HP
- Backstab
    * Damage increased 2.5 → 2.7 HP
- Viper Strikes
    * Poison amplifier increased 1 → 2 levels

### Knight
!!! note "Developer's Note"
    Battlebind was very well received by the community. However, it also heavily incentivized 
    moat camping, which we want to avoid. Hopefully, nerfing its uptime will see a decrease in 
    how active it is for moats.

- Battlebind
    * Cooldown increased 10 → 15 seconds
 
### Brute
!!! note "Developer's Note"
    We recognize Takedown will be overshadowed by Skullsplitter. However, this addition aims to 
    comply with our philosophy explained in our latest [dev blog](/blog/2025/02/06/experimental-beta-changes/). Takedown will receive some changes in the near future but, for 
    now, it will remain as is.

    
- Seismic Slam
    * Cooldown decreased 20 → 18 seconds
<div class="annotate" markdown>
- Add Skullsplitter skill (1)
    * Throw your axe forward and follow the its path once it lands. If it hits an enemy, they will bleed for 4.0 seconds.
    * Cooldown at 16 seconds

### Ranger
!!! note "Developer's Note"
    Wind Dagger proved to be a little underwhelming in comparison to Wolf's Pounce and Disengage. 
    These changes aim to increase its effectiveness and reduce its downtime. Hopefully, this will 
    see an increase in its viability. The remaining changes aim to make the kit a bit more 
    active, instead of forcing players to play back and wait for their skills to be off cooldown. 
- Wind Dagger
    * Cooldown decreased 10 → 8 seconds
    * Damage increased 4.0 → 6.0 HP
- Agility
    * Cooldown decreased 20 → 16 seconds
- Wind Burst
    * Cooldown decreased 18 → 16 seconds
- Wolfs Fury
    * Cooldown decreased 25 → 16 seconds
    * Strength duration 5 → 4 seconds
