This was with the purpose of not only simplifying the experience of the average player but also toning down the general gameplay speed that many players struggle with. Mainly, Assassin is too fast to fight with combinations like Evade and Flash or a standalone Leap build. </p> <p>This first developer blog aims to help everybody understand why we made these changes, and if they will stay at all. Here we go.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#why","title":"\u2753 Why?","text":"<p>To sum it up: the game is too fast, in an unorthodox way. Assassin has all the main components that make other kits good, all combined into one. The other kits feel slow, so Assassin's mobility effectiveness is exacerbated by how slow everything else is. Lastly, damage output is really high, especially especially in particular match-ups like Assassin and  Mage. In combination, the fast movement some skills offer and high damage output directly  decrease the time to to get a kill (refered to as TTK in the rest of this blog), making fights  shorter and the need for really quick reaction time higher.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#assassins-mobility","title":"\ud83d\udca8 Assassin's Mobility","text":"<p>As was mentioned before, Assassin has really high mobility. It is the most mobile kit in the game, even despite the experimental changes made to Ranger. To establish a comparison, Ranger has very mobile options in its kit such as Wolfs Pounce, Wind Burst, Roped Arrow, and Kinetics. However, Assassin still outshines it because its skill are much more versatile. Because Flash's teleport distance is so short and its downtime is essentially nil, it provides an easy way to engage, navigate, and escape a fight. Leap, on the other hand, is a little less versatile but is much more consistent, meaning it's easier to stay out once you've already gotten out.</p> <p>Some kits being this fast while others having little to no movement opportunities at all, directly hinders the experience of players using the latter. We saw an influx of complaints made by tank players who were very frustrated that Assassin was seemingly impossible to catch, forcing them to take the mirror matchup to stand a chance. On the flip side, it also felt impossible to escape a fight, so there was really no benefit to playing tank in a movement-rich meta. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#high-damage-output","title":"\u2694\ufe0f High Damage Output","text":"<p>The TTK in our iteration of the game used to be really high on launch. In updates  following our release, we made some changes to mitigate that. Unfortunately, we seemed to have overshot some values, causing TTK to go from ill-kill-you-in-three-business-days  to i-closed-my-eyes-for-a-second-and-i-died. This was made very notorious in the Blink-Sever  and the Rupture-Pestilence metas. </p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#skill-ceilings-and-skill-floors","title":"\ud83d\udcca Skill ceilings and skill floors","text":"<p>Skill ceilings and skill floors are a way for us to control what can and can't be done with a kit, both at best and worst levels of gameplay. If we increase a kit's skill celing, then the skill expression of that kit is more noticeable and one can feel it to be more rewarding. If we decrease a kit's skill floor, then the power of that kit at its base will be better and using it will becoming more rewarding without requiring much effort. </p> <p>Most kits have controlled skill ceilings by restricting certain behaviors or  breakpoints on skills. An example of this is Inferno with a simple hold-and-shoot  mechanic, and Seismic Slam with a classic point-and-click one. These skills feel easy to use because their skill floor is very low, but their equally low skill ceiling also make  it feel like you can't get much more out of the skill.</p> <p>There has to be a balance between a skill floor and a skill ceiling, because it could open the door for what we call noob skills or for a single skill to dominate the entire lobby. People tend to not care when somebody gets stomped on by someone who is using  Flash very effectively because it is perceived as skillfull, whereas they are disgusted  by the sight of somebody using Sever and Viper Strikes to almost one-tap them.</p> <p>This brings me to my point: Assassin's skill ceiling and skill floor are both too high.  The kit is hard to use at base, and its skill ceiling being infinitely-high make so hard  to master. We are still seeing new techniques be discovered to this very date. However, this has come at the cost of other kits suffering from this grand mastery of Assassin,  because players can only be as good as their kit allows them to be.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#3-the-big-three","title":"3\ufe0f\u20e3 The big three","text":"<p>Finally, let's go back to the components we mentioned Assassin steals from other kits and condenses all into its kit. In our vision, the three necessary components for a kit to be viable in this game are the following:</p> <ul> <li>Engage</li> <li>Sustain</li> <li>Escape</li> </ul> <p>While most kits have two, at most, Assassin possesses all three. Brute has all the engage and sustain in the world, but it lacks escape after comitting everything to engage in a fight. Warlock has engage with Grasp and its speed skills, sustain with its healing and damage reduction skills, although it lacks escape. The other three kits only possess a single one of them, which is why they are perceived as the worst of the 6 kits: Mage with only engage, Knight with only sustain, and Ranger with only escape.</p> <p>Enter Assassin. It has it all. It has engage with all three of the movement skills. It can extend a fight with either Evade, Smoke Bomb or Recall, therefore increasing its sustain. And it also has escape with any axe or drop passive that they haven't already used. This, combined with the exponentially high skill ceiling of the kit, pair to make a deadly combination of damage and mobility that make the kit so fun, but so obnoxious to fight. </p> <p>The reality is that, if you aren't already accustomed to moving your mouse at hyperspeed to fight an Assassin flashing around you, you're likely to be intimidated by this gameplay. This is why we feel something has to change, despite what many will think or say.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#our-plan","title":"\ud83d\udcd5 Our Plan","text":"<p>While everybody would love to nerf Assassin to the ground, it's simply not the fix. It is  the most beloved kit of the roster, and we think the solution is not to reduce mobility,  but rather increase it across the board. It may seem counterintuitive, but high movement  feels fun and being slow does not. Our solution is to level the playing field and provide  everybody a way to catch up to targets who run away, and another to escape fights when  needed.</p> <p>Of course, this all comes with reducing damage values on most skills and tinkering with  health statistics on kits, but the general idea is already in play. In turn, we should  expect a much more dynamic game, with faster gameplay on kits that were slow. On the  contrary, we must also reduce movement for kits that feel too fast, just so we can give a  little bit of breathing room to those who are not. This allows us to nerf Assassin's  movement a bit and buff it for other kits, so the entire gameplay loop feels much more fair,  without removing the fun of mobility.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#removing-skill-levels","title":"\ud83d\udcc9 Removing Skill Levels","text":"<p>The most controversial change, as we expected, was the removal of skill levels. This  change does not come out of out the blue, and was really thought through before being  applied. We have explored many other balancing options to make skills pair well with each  other and have fair matchups for every kit. However, this was to no avail, as some skills  just simply could not be used without investing a big percentage of your skill tokens  (41%!), while others didn't make sense to invest into.</p> <p>Our previous balancing philosophy with skill levels posed two problems: - Most skills required too many levels to be viable. - The remaining skills made very little sense to invest skill tokens into.</p> <p>Some examples of this are: - Flash 5 is usable while Flash 1 is not. - Pestilence 5 is usable while Pestilence 1 is not. - Leap 1 is usable while Leap 5 is not necessary in the current meta.</p> <p>While this is somewhat the purpose of having skill levels, to have to invest into a skill to make  it good, it just did not seem worth it to keep skill levels when they either did not matter at  all or completely forced you on a specific build. As it stands, having to invest 5 skill tokens  into an axe skill then 6 others across your passive and sword skills made it so you did not pick  a global passive.  With these experimental changes, there still is going to be a meta build, but  you'll be able to allocate a skill in every slot without having to worry about investing all your  skill tokens into it. </p> <p>This does remove some depth from the game, but it would be replaced with depth elsewhere if these  changes were to go through for release. The very starting point for Clans is Champions. Clans is  hard enough to understand already, now imagine trying to understand Champions while trying to  learn Clans. If the very most basic unit in Champions is a kit, then it should be easy to  understand, then you dive into the depth of the game by yourself, at your own pace. Having to  worry about meta builds and what skill to invest into by having to try every skill and learn  their scaling is intimidating, to say the least.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#balancing","title":"\u2696\ufe0f Balancing","text":"<p>With skill levels gone, balancing should be done easier. With 5 skill levels on some skills, we  would have to balance 5 different iterations of a single skill at once, which mean that we had to  find a proper scaling to make levels significant and worth investing into. This led to us either  making a skill really bad at base to make the highest level worth investing into, or not having  any significant scaling at all. Removing levels allows us to focus in a single iteration of the  skill, having richer balance.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/02/07/experimental-beta-changes/#what-happens-to-booster-power-and-ancient-weapons","title":"\u2b50 What happens to booster, power, and ancient weapons?","text":"<p>Temporarily, booster, power, and ancient weapons have been set to simply deal extra damage. That  is, 6.5, 7.0 and 7.5 extra damage, respectively. For now, these items will remain the same until  we decide whether to keep these experimental changes or not.</p> <p>An idea we had is to have booster weapons change skill behavior rather than skill statistics. For  example, a booster weapon with Inferno would make it have a shotgun effect or make Seismic Slam  hurl enemies into the air before slamming up and then down.
